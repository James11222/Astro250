### Final Project

Welcome to my final project for Astro 250. For this course I chose to package my research code into a useable python code suite that is pip installable. 
To check out the code please visit the [Sarabande](https://github.com/James11222/sarabande) repo for more details. 

For use of this package you can check out the sarabande package on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/sarabande/) or directly install via 

`pip install sarabande`

A video demonstration can be found [Here](https://youtu.be/mKi50mm5W3c)!

Building this Package used the following core concepts from the course:

* Packaging Python Code
* Automated Testing
* Parallel Processing/Threading
