# Machine Learning

This homework focuses on neural networks for supervised and deep learning. The homework also touches on auto-encoders which are incredibly useful tools for data analysis.

All relavant info is in `HW6.ipynb`. I wrote this notebook in Google Colab to make use of the GPU runtime feature. This GPU runtime feature allowed for training the CNN in reasonable time. The notebook should work running from start to finish. I don't include saved models and logs here due to memory storage concerns but each model should generate as intended when running the notebook from start to finish.
